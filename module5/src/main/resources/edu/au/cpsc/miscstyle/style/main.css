add style information to this file to accomplish visual changes from assignment file
***DO NOT:
- use Node.setStyle()
- call Node methods that impact the appearance of controls beyond their layout
- modify FXML files that impact appearance of layouts or controls beyond basic layout (border,background,color,font, etc.
- pretty much keep the modifications in this file**

1. Set the background color of the element with CSS ID background to #dad7cd.

2.  Set the fill color of the elements with ids foreground, highlight and accent to #272838, #ff6b6b
and #7e7f9a respectively.

3.  Create a border around the Rectangle inside a Group inside a VBox.  The border should be 5px
wide, stroked inside the rectangle's bounds and have a color with RGB components 70, 155,
75.

4.  Set the fill for the Rectangle in step 3 to a completely transparent color (so you can see through
it).  Note: you cannot use -fx-opacity here because that will also make the border of the
Rectangle transparent.

5.  You should now be able to see a Circle behind the Rectangle.  Set its fill color to #7e7f9a. 6.
There are three Hyperlink objects in the scene.  Two of them (Google and Bing) have been set
to the "visited" state.  Modify all Hyperlinks to have the following properties:
    - Text color #ff6b6b and underlined (notice that non-visited Hyperlinks are normally not
        underlined).
    - Text color for visited Hyperlinks #272838.

7.  ComboBoxes are an example of elements with substructure.  Look the the JavaFX CSS
reference's description of this control.  (You might have to look at one of its superclasses to find
the substructure...just follow the links!). Notice that it has two sub-elements one with CSS class
arrow-button and one with CSS class arrow.  Change the background color of all arrow
buttons on all ComboBoxes to #ff6b6b and the background color of all arrows on all
ComboBoxes to white.  Do not impact elements with CSS class arrow that are not in
ComboBoxes.  I have placed two labels next to the ComboBox that have these CSS classes
and these labels should not be impacted by your changes.

8.  CheckBoxes also have substructure.  Study the documentation and change the background of
the checkmark to #7e7f9a.

9.  There is an HBox (CSS id button-row) containing three buttons.  Modify the alignment of the
elements in that HBox so that they are centered vertically and right-aligned horizontally.
